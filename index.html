                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
                and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                beyond the world of known physics.

                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of
                light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in

                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
                whether it could ever be proved.

            <p class="main-article-p">
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
                of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
                and space and energy to science and speculation.

                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
                its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
                of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
                reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
                would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
                general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

            <p class="main-article-p">
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that

                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of

                Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            <h1 class="inflation-theory">The Theory of Inflation</h1>
            <img src="assets/inflation-945.png">
            <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe
                expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
            <span>THE UNIVERSE</span>
            <p>is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere
                that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe
                has an even temperature.</p>

            <span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>
            <p>The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe
                to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an
                even temperature.</p>

            <span>DISTANT COFFEE</span>
            <p>At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and
                from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>

            <span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span>
            <p> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the
                same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to
                look for another explanation.</p>

            <span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>
            <p>There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all
                the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain
                their even temperature.</p>

            <span>INFLATION</span>
            <p>solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the
                universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field
                eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>

            <span>FLUCTUATION</span>
            <p> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the
                cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational
                waves predicted by Einstein.</p>

            <span> EXPANSION</span>
            <p>Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even
                temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors
                the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
